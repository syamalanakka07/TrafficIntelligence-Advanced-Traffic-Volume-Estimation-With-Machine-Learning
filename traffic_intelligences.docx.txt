ðŸš¦ Project Report â€“ TrafficTelligence: Traffic Volume Prediction Using Machine Learning
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Project Overview
TrafficTelligence is a web-based AI solution that predicts traffic volume based on various input features like weather, holidays, and time. It leverages machine learning to provide real-time predictions, assisting city planners, commuters, and logistics companies in planning ahead.
1.2 Purpose
To build a predictive model that forecasts traffic volume using historical data and make it accessible via an easy-to-use web interface.
2. IDEATION PHASE
2.1 Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion is a persistent problem affecting productivity, environment, and quality of life. Anticipating traffic volume can improve infrastructure planning and traffic management.
2.2 Empathy Map Canvas
Users: City commuters, municipal planners, logistics companies
Needs: Accurate predictions of traffic volume in various weather and time conditions
Pains: Delays, fuel costs, environmental impact
Gains: Smarter route planning, better scheduling, efficient traffic management
2.3 Brainstorming
- Use weather and time-based features for prediction
- Develop a machine learning model
- Deploy the solution via a simple web app
- Ensure it is user-friendly for non-technical users
